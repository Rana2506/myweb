# CRITICAL FIX APPLIED - Navigation Links Issue Resolved

## 🔧 Problem Identified and Fixed:

The main issue was that **ALL navigation links in your header were using absolute paths WITHOUT the repository baseurl prefix**.

### What was wrong:
```html
<!-- WRONG - Missing {{ site.baseurl }} -->
<a href="/about.html">About Us</a>
<a href="/services.html">Services</a>
<a href="/contact-us.html">Contact Us</a>
```

### What I fixed:
```html
<!-- CORRECT - With {{ site.baseurl }} -->
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/about.html">About Us</a>
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/services.html">Services</a>
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/contact-us.html">Contact Us</a>
```

## ✅ Files Fixed:

1. **`_config.yml`** - Enhanced with proper Jekyll settings
2. **`_includes/head.html`** - Fixed ALL navigation links to use `{{ site.baseurl }}`
3. **`index.html`** - Fixed internal page links
4. **Multiple product pages** - Fixed asset paths

## 🚀 To Deploy Your Fix:

### Step 1: Commit and Push Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix navigation links and asset paths for GitHub Pages"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Wait for Deployment
- Go to your repository on GitHub
- Click "Actions" tab to monitor the build
- Wait for the green checkmark (takes 2-5 minutes)

### Step 3: Test Your Site
Your site will be available at: **`https://rana2506.github.io/myweb/`**

### Step 4: Test Navigation Links
Now these should work:
- ✅ `https://rana2506.github.io/myweb/about.html`
- ✅ `https://rana2506.github.io/myweb/services.html`
- ✅ `https://rana2506.github.io/myweb/contact-us.html`
- ✅ `https://rana2506.github.io/myweb/ppe.html`
- ✅ `https://rana2506.github.io/myweb/life-line-system.html`

## 🎯 Key Points:

1. **Always use the full URL with `/myweb/`** - Don't try to access pages without the repository path
2. **Navigation menu will now work correctly** - All links in the header have been fixed
3. **Product dropdown will work** - All product page links are now correct
4. **Internal page links work** - All buttons and links use proper baseurl

## 📝 Remember:
- Your repository name is `myweb`
- Always access via: `https://rana2506.github.io/myweb/`
- NOT: `https://rana2506.github.io/` (this won't work)

The navigation issue has been completely resolved!
